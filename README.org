#+TITLE: Ox-Hugo: A carefully crafted Org exporter back-end that enables writing Hugo posts in Org
#+AUTHOR: Kaushal Modi
=ox-hugo= is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to
[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]-compatible Markdown ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]]). That also includes the
generation of front matter (in TOML or YAML format) for Hugo
posts.

Here is the blogging flow when using this package:
- Write blog posts in Org
  - One post per Org subtree (preferred)
  - One post per Org file (/works but you won't be able to leverage
    Org-specific benefits like tag and property inheritance, use of
    TODO states to translate to post =draft= state, etc./)
- Export only the *current* post Org subtree, or export all post
  subtrees.
- Set up =org-capture= (see below) to quickly start writing new posts.
- Use =after-save-hook= to export current post subtree to Markdown on
  each save.

This project consists of =ox-blackfriday.el= too. It is a derivation
of [[https://github.com/larstvei/ox-gfm][=ox-gfm=]] with support added for Blackfriday Markdown tables and
many other tweaks. =ox-hugo= backend extends from this.
* Formatting
Below table shows the translation of Org markup to Markdown markup in
the exported =.md= files.

See the Org source in [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content-org/all-posts.org][=all-posts.org=]] under /Formatting/ -> /General/
heading and how it exports to Markdown in [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content/posts/general-formatting.md][=general-formatting.md=]].

(Note: If you see two equal signs on each side of /monospace/ in the
/Org/ column in the table above, it is a bug with GitHub's Org
renderer.. just see those as *single* equal signs on each side of
/monospace/ instead.)
* Example Hugo site to test this package
A little [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/example-site][example-site]] with bare-bones "theme" is used to live-test the
package (you'll know why theme is double-quoted once you try out the
example-site on =hugo=.. it's not for visuals.. just for testing :)).

Check out the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content-org/all-posts.org][example single Org file]]. That is created for testing various
Org->Hugo content and meta-data translation features. [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/example-site/content/posts][Here]] are the
exported Markdown files.

* Why =ox-hugo=?
Using Org just as a markup like Markdown is a miniscule part of its
complete feature-set. Org also allows stuff like:
- Easy ordering/manipulation/commenting of subtrees
- Creating tables (with even formulas like in Excel)
- Directly including source code snippets from external files (instead
  of having to copy/paste them in)
- Running code snippets within the Org file and embedding the results
  (Org Babel)
- ..

Using Org for content writing allows using in-built Org features to
translate to Hugo front matter:

- Org uses an outline structure and can inherit meta data (tags and
  properties) from one subtree to children subtrees.
- Using that feature, one can tag one tree as /emacs/, and everything
  under that tree (all posts under that) will get that tag
  automatically.
- The same concept applies to inheriting any Org /property/ meta data
  like menu entry, category, section name, etc.
- A subtree can be quickly marked to be in TODO state (default binding
  =C-c C-t=). A *TODO* post is marked as a /draft/ Hugo post.
- The /menu-item weights/ and/or /post weights/ can be set to be
  auto-calculated so that the menu items or post order in the final
  HTML appear in the same order as the respective subtrees in Org.

  If the subtrees are re-ordered in Org, the weights get changed too.
- One can have a subtree with section property set to "posts" and all
  post subtrees under that will go to that section. Similarly another
  parent subtree can have that property set to "articles", and so on.
- Images can be displayed inline in the Org buffer.
- After save hooks can be set up in Emacs so that each time I save the
  file, only the current subtree in Org gets exported to
  Markdown. With the Hugo server running with the new switch that auto
  changes the preview to the last changed post (=--navigateToChanged=
  introduced in Hugo 0.25), the flow is seamless -- Save the Org file
  and see the exact changed post in browser.
- *All* posts can simply be subtrees in a single Org file. That way
  one can take advantage of Org subtree filtering and searching
  functions (=org-sparse-tree= bound to =C-c /= by default).
- (and much more..)
* Translation of Org meta-data to Hugo front matter
Many Hugo front matter variables get set implicitly using the
meta-data parsed from the posts in Org.

* How to try =ox-hugo=?
1. Clone this repo.
2. =cd= to the =example-site/= directory and do:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   - =--navigateToChanged= requires Hugo 0.25+.
3. Above command will mention the localhost where the site is
   served. Open that in your browser.
4. In emacs, =(require  'ox-hugo)= or evaluate the =ox-hugo.el= from the
   cloned repo.
5. Open the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content-org/all-posts.org][=all-posts.org=]] file.
6. =C-c C-e H A= -- That will export *all* subtrees in the file to
   Markdown files.
7. In few seconds, dozens of test posts will get created, with the
   =hugo server= aided preview in the browser zapping through each new
   created post (needs that new feature =--navigateToChanged=
   introduced in Hugo 0.25).
* Debug
If the =ox-hugo= exports do not work as expected, or if you get an
error backtrace,
1. Open an [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues][Issue]].
2. Describe the problem you are seeing.
3. Provide the debug info using =org-hugo-debug-info=:
   - =M-x org-hugo-debug-info= (that will copy the debug info in
     Markdown format to the kill ring)
   - Paste the Markdown contents in the GitHub issue.
     - You can still hit the /Preview/ tab of the Issue before
       submitting it.
