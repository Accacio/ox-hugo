=ox-hugo= is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to
[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]-compatible Markdown ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]]) and also generates the
front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

This project consists of =ox-blackfriday.el= too. It is a derivation
of [[https://github.com/larstvei/ox-gfm][=ox-gfm=]] with support added for Blackfriday Markdown tables and
many other tweaks. =ox-hugo= backend extends from this.

* Screenshots
Before you read further, you can see below how =ox-hugo= translates
Org to Markdown (Org on the left; exported Markdown with Hugo
front-matter on the right).
** One post per Org subtree (preferred)
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-subtree.png][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-subtree.png]]

** One post per Org file
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-file.png][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/static/images/one-post-per-file.png]]

** Editorial
The preferred way to organize the posts is as Org subtrees (also the
main reason to write this package, as nothing like that was out there)
as it makes the meta-data management for Hugo front-matter pretty
effortless.

If you are a /one Org-file per post/ type of a person, that flow works
too! Just note that in this flow many of those =#+HUGO_= properties
need to be managed manually.. just as one would manage the front-matter
in Markdown files --- See the Org versions in the above screenshots for
comparison.
* Documentation
=ox-hugo= uses *itself* to generate its documentation!

https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/

You can generate the same too! Simply clone this repo and do =make
doc=.

- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving][Auto exporting to Markdown each time the Org file is saved]]
- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/org-capture-setup][Using Org Capture to start a new blog post]]

** Source of the Documentation site
- [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/doc/ox-hugo-manual.org][Org source]]
- =ox-hugo= exported [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/doc/content][Markdown files]]

* Demo
[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site/content-org][Org source]] → [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site/content][Exported Markdown]] → [[file:../test][*Hugo published test site*]]

Now, the test site doesn't look pretty, I know :) .. because:
- It is designed to verify if all the content translates from Org to
  Markdown as expected.
- It uses a [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site/themes/bare_min/][*bare_min*]] /theme/ written just for the debug purpose (not
  presentation).

/See [[https://themes.gohugo.io/][Hugo Themes]] for examples of really good site prettification and
presentation styles./
** Actual usage examples
- https://ox-hugo.scripter.co -- =ox-hugo= Documentation Site
- [[https://scripter.co]] -- My blog

* Installation
This package requires emacs 24.5+ and Org 9.0+. It is available on
Melpa ([[https://melpa.org/#/ox-hugo]]).
* Usage
Once the package is installed, you will need to /require/ it so that
the =ox-hugo= export options are available in the /Org Export
Dispatcher/ menu (the one you see when you hit =C-c C-e= to initiate
any export).

You can do that by adding the below to your config:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'ox
  (require 'ox-hugo))
#+END_SRC
If you use =use-package=, you can do the below instead:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-hugo
  :after ox)
#+END_SRC

*Spacemacs*

Spacemacs users can choose to add this snippet to their
=dotspacemacs/user-config= function in =.spacemacs=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  ;; Other stuff
  ;; ..

  ;; ox-hugo config
  (use-package ox-hugo
    :ensure t                           ;Auto-install the package from Melpa
    :after ox))
#+END_SRC

If you do so, you *also need to* add =ox-hugo= to
=dotspacemacs-additional-packages=.

/Verified to work on Spacemacs =develop= branch with =spacemacs-base=
distribution, =emacs= editing style./
** Before you export
Before you export check that these properties are set as you need:
- HUGO_SECTION :: The default Hugo section name for all the posts.  See
  [[http://gohugo.io/content/sections/][here]] for more information on Hugo sections.  It is
  common for this property to be set to =posts= or
  =blog=.  The default value is set using
  =org-hugo-default-section-directory=.
- HUGO_BASE_DIR :: Root directory of the source for the Hugo site. If
  this is set to =~/hugo/=, the exported Markdown
  files will be saved to
  =~/hugo/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/= directory.  By
  default, the Markdown files reside in a hierarchy
  under the =content/= directory in the site root
  directory ([[http://gohugo.io/content/organization/][ref]]). If you try to export without
  setting this property, you will get this error:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    user-error: It is mandatory to set the HUGO_BASE_DIR property
  #+END_EXAMPLE

*Important*: If you choose to export an Org subtree as a post, you
 need to set the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= subtree property. That property is
 used by this package to figure out where the current post starts.
** Export bindings
The common =ox-hugo= export bindings are:
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Binding       | Description                                                                         |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-e H H= | Export only the current /valid/ subtree (has the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property set)   |
| =C-c C-e H A= | Export *all* /valid/ subtrees (those that have the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property set) |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-e H h= | Export the whole Org file to a single post                                          |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

available customization options for this package.
* Changelog
** v0.4 <2017-10-28 Sat>
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Restore the default Org behavior of =#+TAGS=. Now that keyword (and
  the =EXPORT_TAGS= property) is *not* used by =ox-hugo=. Fixes
  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/89][89]]].
- File-based exports must now use =#+HUGO_TAGS= to set the post tags.
- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_TAGS= property to
  override Org-style tags on the same headline (and the ones inherited
  from Org-style tags from any of the parent subtrees and
  =#+FILETAGS=).
  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+FILETAGS= can be used to
    set tags globally in the file. Earlier =#+TAGS= was used for that
    purpose.
- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_CATEGORIES= property
  to override Org-style categories (tags with "@" prefix) on the same
  headline (and the ones inherited from Org-style categories from any
  of the parent subtrees and =#+FILETAGS=).
  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+FILETAGS= can be used to
    set categories (tags with "@") globally in the file.

See the new section added to documentation:
[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/tags-and-categories][*Tags and Categories*]]
** v0.3.2 <2017-10-24 Tue>
*** Fixes
- Fix issue with headline metadata parsing (ALLTAGS, CLOSED, TODO)
  when a post Org heading was immediately followed by that post's
  sub-heading.  This issue was seen in subtree-based exports
  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/87][87]]].
** v0.3.1 <2017-10-19 Thu>
*** Fixes
- Fix the source block line number annotation when the line numbers
  increased in number of digits in the same code block.
** v0.3 <2017-10-18 Wed>
*** Features
- Source blocks can now be exported with line numbers and/or
  highlighting!

  See [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/source-blocks][Source Blocks]] for details.
** v0.2.3 <2017-10-11 Wed>
*** Fixes
- =org-hugo-slug= earlier stripped off only the =code= HTML tag
  (~<code> .. </code>~) from the input string, if present. Now it does
  that for *any* HTML tag, like =span=. For example, this HTML gets
  stripped off from the above heading (only inside =org-hugo-slug=
  when deriving the slug string): ~<span
    class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2017-10-11
    Wed&gt;</span></span>~.
** v0.2.2 <2017-10-10 Tue>
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Now =ox-hugo= by default requires text, to be sub/super-scripted, to
  be wrapped in ={}=. So now =a_b= will be exported as =a_b=, but
  =a_{b}= will be exported as =a<sub>b</sub>=. To revert back to the
  earlier behavior, user needs to add =#+OPTIONS: ^:t= to their Org
  file.
** v0.2.1 <2017-09-28 Thu>
*** Fixes
- Single column tables now export correctly [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/84][84]]].
- Ignore =HUGO_WEIGHT= set to =auto= for /per-file/ exports
  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/83][83]]].
** v0.2 <2017-09-27 Wed>
*** Features
- Add support for all Hugo =figure= shortcode parameters
  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/79][79]]].
- New option =org-hugo-delete-trailing-ws= defaults to =t=; now Hugo
  deletes trailing white-spaces by default.
- New options =org-hugo-default-static-subdirectory-for-externals= and
  =org-hugo-external-file-extensions-allowed-for-copying= (related to
  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/69][69]]]).
*** Fixes
- Remove =HUGO_STATIC_IMAGE= option; fix attachment re-write
  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/69][69]]].
- Fix incorrectly inserted hard line-breaks [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/72][72]]]. Added a
  new option =HUGO_PRESERVE_FILLING=.
- Fix error happening when a post title was set to an empty string
  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/ba9e8365f6ee42f030ed806bf5ec42d6acce4c76][ba9e8365]]].
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Switch the default value of =org-hugo-use-code-for-kbd= option to
  =nil= [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/88ba15ae9bc809b0983315446c88fecfda3534e5][88ba15ae]]].
** v0.1.3 <2017-09-13 Wed>
- Now a HUGO key value set to ="nil"=, like =#+HUGO_CODE_FENCE: nil=,
  will evaluate as /nil/ instead of /t/, as now
  =org-hugo--plist-get-true-p= is used to parse boolean keys instead
  of =plist-get=.
** v0.1.2 <2017-09-12 Tue>
- Make DateTime matching better; new internal variable
  =org-hugo--date-time-regexp=. Earlier time zones ahead of UTC (with
  =+= sign) were not detected as dates in =org-hugo--quote-string= and
  thus were unnecessarily quoted.
** v0.1.1 <2017-09-11 Mon>
- Use CLOSED log drawer info if available to set the date in
  front-matter [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/68][68]]].
- Code optimization: Use of =org-entry-get= at places instead of
  maintaining global variables.
