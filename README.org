=ox-hugo= is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to
[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]-compatible Markdown ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]]). That also includes the
generation of front matter (in TOML or YAML format) required for Hugo
posts.

Here is the blogging flow when using this package:
- Write blog posts in Org
  - One post per Org subtree (preferred)
  - One post per Org file (/works but you won't be able to leverage
    Org-specific benefits like tag and property inheritance, use of
    TODO states to translate to post =draft= state, etc./)
- Export only the *current* post Org subtree
- Export all post subtrees
- Set up =org-capture= (see below) to quickly start writing new posts.
- Use =after-save-hook= to export current post subtree to Markdown on
  each save.

This project consists of =ox-blackfriday.el= too. It is a derivation
of [[https://github.com/larstvei/ox-gfm][=ox-gfm=]] with support added for Blackfriday Markdown tables and
few other tweaks. =ox-hugo= backend extends from this.

There is a plan to create a =hugo.el= that would do things like:
- New post creation using =org-capture= (port code from [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d/blob/master/setup-files/setup-hugo.el][here]]).
- Interactive functions to toggle /draft/ state,
  add/remove/increment/decrement /publishdate/ property.
- Option to use template =config.toml= and some default hugo theme. So
  all a new user would need to do is to (i) have the =hugo= [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases][binary]] in
  =PATH= (ii) define their =hugo= blog dir in the =defcustom= (iii)
  =M-x hugo=.
- Set separate faces for titles based on /draft/ state and
  /futureness/.

* Formatting
Below table shows the translation of Org markup to Markdown markup in
the exported =.md= files.

See the Org source in [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content-org/all-posts.org][=all-posts.org=]] under /Formatting/ -> /General/
heading and how it exports to Markdown in [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content/posts/general-formatting.md][=general-formatting.md=]].

(Note: If you see two equal signs on each side of /monospace/ in the
/Org/ column in the table above, it is a bug with GitHub's Org
renderer.. just see those as *single* equal signs on each side of
/monospace/ instead.)
* Example Hugo site to test this package
A little [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/example-site][example-site]] with bare-bones "theme" is used to live-test the
package (you'll know why theme is double-quoted once you try out the
example-site on =hugo=.. it's not for visuals.. just for testing :)).

Check out the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content-org/all-posts.org][example single Org file]]. That is created for testing various
Org->Hugo content and meta-data translation features. [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/example-site/content/posts][Here]] are the
exported Markdown files.

* Why =ox-hugo=?
Using Org just as a markup like Markdown is a miniscule part of its
complete feature-set. Org also allows stuff like:
- Easy ordering/manipulation/commenting of subtrees
- Creating tables (with even formulas like in Excel)
- Directly including source code snippets from external files (instead
  of having to copy/paste them in)
- Running code snippets within the Org file and embedding the results
  (Org Babel)
- ..

Using Org for content writing allows using inbuilt Org features to
translate to Hugo front matter:

- Org uses an outline structure and can inherit meta data (tags and
  properties) from one subtree to children subtrees.
- Using that feature, one can tag one tree as /emacs/, and everything
  under that tree (all posts under that) will get that tag
  automatically.
- The same concept applies to inheriting any Org /property/ meta data
  like menu entry, category, section name, etc.
- A subtree can be quickly marked to be in TODO state. That
  information is used to add the /draft/ meta data to the post front
  matter.
- The post menu weights can be auto-set so that the menu items order
  in the final HTML is the same order as that of those post subtrees
  in Org.

  If the subtrees are reordered in Org, the weights get changed
  implicitly.
- One can have a subtree with section property set to "posts" and all
  post subtrees under that will go to that section. Similarly another
  parent subtree can have that property set to "articles", and so on.
- Images can be displayed inline in the Org buffer.
- After save hooks can be set up in Emacs so that each time I save the
  file, only the current subtree in Org gets exported to
  Markdown. With the Hugo server running with the new switch that auto
  changes the preview to the last changed post (=--navigateToChanged=
  introduced in Hugo 0.25), the flow is seamless -- Save the Org file
  and see the exact changed post in browser.
- *All* posts can simply be subtrees in a single Org file. That way
  one can take advantage of Org subtree filtering and searching
  functions.
- (and much more..)

* Implicit setting of Hugo front matter variables in Org
|---------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Hugo front matter (TOML)  | Org                        | Org description                      |
|---------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| =title = "foo"â€‹=           | =* foo=                    | Heading                              |
| =date = 2017-07-24=       | =:EXPORT_DATE: 2017-07-24= | Subtree property                     |
| =tags = ["abc", "def"]=   | =* foo :abc:def:=           | Heading tags                         |
| =categories = ["x", "y"]= | =* foo :@x:@y:=             | Heading tags with =@= prefix         |
| =draft = true=            | =* TODO foo=               | Heading set to TODO (or DRAFT)       |
| =draft = false=           | =* foo=                    | Heading *not* set to TODO (or DRAFT) |
|---------------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------------|
* Try =ox-hugo=
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run =hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture --navigateToChanged= in
   =example-site/= directory.
   - =--navigateToChanged= requires Hugo 0.25+.
3. Above command will mention the localhost where the site is
   served.Open that in your browser.
4. In emacs, =(require  'ox-hugo)= or evaluate the =ox-hugo.el= from the
   cloned repo.
5. Open the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content-org/all-posts.org][=all-posts.org=]] file.
6. =C-c C-e H A= -- Export *all* subtrees in the file to Markdown files.
7. In few seconds, 40+ test posts will get created, with the hugo server
   preview in the browser zapping through each new created post (needs
   that new Hugo 0.25 feature).
* Debug
If the =ox-hugo= exports do not work as expected, or if you get an
error backtrace,
1. Open an [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues][Issue]].
2. Describe the problem you are seeing.
3. Provide the debug info using =org-hugo-debug-info=:
   - =M-x org-hugo-debug-info= (that will copy the debug info in
     Markdown format to the kill ring)
   - Paste the Markdown contents in the GitHub issue.
     - You can still hit the /Preview/ tab of the Issue before
       submitting it.
