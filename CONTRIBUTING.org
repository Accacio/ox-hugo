NOTE TO FUTURE CONTRIBUTORS: I plan to merge this package into GNU
Elpa or Org source at some point.

So you will need to assign your copyright to FSF in order to get your
patches accepted.

- [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html][Why assign copyright to FSF?]]
- [[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html#Copyright-Papers][How to start this process]]

As a bonus, once you have assigned your copyright to FSF, doors open up
for your future contributions to Emacs too!
* Debug
If the =ox-hugo= exports do not work as expected, or if you get an
error backtrace,
1. Open an [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues][Issue]].
2. Describe the problem you are seeing.
3. Provide the debug info using =org-hugo-debug-info=:
   - =M-x org-hugo-debug-info= (that will copy the debug info in
     Markdown format to the kill ring)
   - Paste the Markdown contents in the GitHub issue.
     - You can still hit the /Preview/ tab of the Issue before
       submitting it.
* Test
1. Clone this repo.
2. =cd= to the =test/example-site/= directory and do:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      make test
   #+END_EXAMPLE
