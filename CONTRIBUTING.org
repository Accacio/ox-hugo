NOTE TO FUTURE CONTRIBUTORS: I plan to merge this package into Org
source.

So please assign your copyright to FSF in order to get your patches
accepted.

- [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html][Why assign copyright to FSF?]]
- [[https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html#Copyright-Papers][How to start this process]]

As a bonus, once you have assigned your copyright to FSF, doors open up
for your contributions to Emacs too!

* Debug
If the =ox-hugo= exports do not work as expected, or if you get an
error backtrace,
1. Open an [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues][Issue]].
2. Describe the problem you are seeing.
3. Provide the debug info using =org-hugo-debug-info=:
   - =M-x org-hugo-debug-info= (that will copy the debug info in
     Markdown format to the kill ring)
   - Paste the Markdown contents in the GitHub issue.
     - You can still hit the /Preview/ tab of the Issue before
       submitting it.
