1. Be the root directory for this Hugo site (the directory containing

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  hugo server --port 1111

3. See the site served on "http://localhost:1111/"
* Post 1
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: post-1

H H=.

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
*To be fixed*: At the moment, you need to place the point here and do
 =C-c C-e H H=. If the point is under any of the nested sub-trees in
 here where you do that, only that subtree gets exported.

/Need to add smarts that determines which subtree contains the whole
post.. like look for =EXPORT_FILE_NAME=?/
** Unclickable image (works!)
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png]]

*To be fixed*: The sub-headings in a post get exported as /Heading 1/
 instead of /Heading 2/.

For example, this sub-section's heading is exported as:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Unclickable image
#+END_EXAMPLE
instead of
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
## Unclickable image
#+END_EXAMPLE

So the sub-heading title and the post title both get the /Heading 1/
tag and look the same size.
** Clickable link that opens the image (works!)

** Clickable image that opens the image (works!)

*** COMMENT Below will not work!
You cannot wrap markdown code inside HTML.

As /rdwatters/ says [[https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/is-it-possible-to-insert-html-code-in-markdown-content/4867/4?u=kaushalmodi][here]],
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
HTML can be part of markdown because HTML-inside-markdown is part of
the spec. That said, remember that the spec disallows markdown nested
inside of HTML. So if you create a div, just make sure everything
inside that div is valid HTML.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_EXPORT md
<div class="inset">
#+END_EXPORT
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png]]
#+BEGIN_EXPORT md
</div>

Here are few variables that you might like to change in the =local.mk=:
- =prefix= :: Org installation directory
 #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
prefix = /dir/where/you/want/to/install/org # Default: /usr/share
#+END_SRC
 The =.el= files will go to =$(prefix)/emacs/site-lisp/org= by
              default. If you'd like to change that, you can tweak the
              =lispdir= variable.
- =infodir= :: Org Info installation directory. I like to keep the
                   Info file for development version of Org in a separate
                   directory.
 #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
infodir = $(prefix)/org/info # Default: $(prefix)/info
#+END_SRC
- =ORG_MAKE_DOC= :: Types of Org documentation you'd like to build by
                    default.
 #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
# Define below you only need info documentation, the default includes html and pdf
ORG_MAKE_DOC = info pdf card # html
#+END_SRC
- =ORG_ADD_CONTRIB= :: Packages from the =contrib/= directory that
     you'd like to build along with Org. Below are the ones on my
     /must-have/ list.
 #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
# Define if you want to include some (or all) files from contrib/lisp
# just the filename please (no path prefix, no .el suffix), maybe with globbing
#   org-eldoc - Headline breadcrumb trail in minibuffer

* Menu in front matter                                                 :menu:
** Menu Meta Data in TOML Front Matter

matter.

:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU_OVERRIDE: :weight 10 :identifier ov-partial
:END:
For this post, we should see just the menu /weight/ and /identifier/
properties get overridden.

You need to set unique menu identifiers, else you get a Hugo error
like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ERROR 2017/07/18 12:32:14 Two or more menu items have the same name/identifier in Menu "main": "menu-meta-data-in-yaml-front-matter".
Rename or set an unique identifier.
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Overriding menu properties completely

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: menu-alist-meta-data-toml-override-full
:EXPORT_DATE: 2017-07-18
:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU: :menu test :weight 50
:END:
For this post, we see that no menu properties are inherited from the
parent; only the menu properties set in his subtree are effective.

:END:
Testing the addition of /menu/ meta data to the YAML front matter.
Here the front matter format is set to YAML using the
=HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_FORMAT= key in property drawer.

Here there is white space in menu entry keyword.
*** White space in menu name

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: menu-meta-data-yaml3

* Articles
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: articles
:END:
** Article 1
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: article-1
:END:
First article.

This will land in =content/articles/= as the parent of this subtree
sets =EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION= to =articles=. Note that the theme needs to
define at least the =single.html= for =articles/=.
** Article 2
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: article-2
:END:
Second article.

This will also land in =content/articles/= the same way.
* TODO Pre-Draft State
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: draft-state-todo
:END:
If a post has the =TODO= keyword, the =draft= front matter variable
should be set to =true=.

Idea to to mark a post or blog idea as =TODO= that you yet have to
start writing.
* DRAFT Draft state
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: draft-state-draft
:END:
If a post has the =DRAFT= keyword too, the =draft= front matter variable
should be set to =true=.

Idea is to mark a post as =DRAFT= that you have already started
writing, or are in the process at the moment, but it is not yet ready
to be published
