#+HUGO_BASE_DIR: ../

* Preparation
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: prep
:END:
1. Be the root directory for this Hugo site (the directory containing
   =config.toml=).
2. Run
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  hugo server --port 1111
  #+END_EXAMPLE
3. See the site served on "http://localhost:1111/"
* Post 1
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: post-1
:END:
Export this *first* post only by moving point here and doing =C-c C-e
H H=.
* Post 2
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: post-2
:END:
Export this *second* post only by moving point here and doing =C-c C-e
H H=.
* Image
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: image
:END:
*To be fixed*: At the moment, you need to place the point here and do
 =C-c C-e H H=. If the point is under any of the nested sub-trees in
 here where you do that, only that subtree gets exported.

/Need to add smarts that determines which subtree contains the whole
post.. like look for =EXPORT_FILE_NAME=?/
** Unclickable image (works!)
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png]]

*To be fixed*: The sub-headings in a post get exported as /Heading 1/
 instead of /Heading 2/.

For example, this sub-section's heading is exported as:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Unclickable image
#+END_EXAMPLE
instead of
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
## Unclickable image
#+END_EXAMPLE

So the sub-heading title and the post title both get the /Heading 1/
tag and look the same size.
** Clickable link that opens the image (works!)

- NOTE :: =file:= has to be used in both Link and Description components
          of the Org link.

*** Below will not work!
You cannot wrap markdown code inside HTML.

As /rdwatters/ says [[https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/is-it-possible-to-insert-html-code-in-markdown-content/4867/4?u=kaushalmodi][here]],
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
HTML can be part of markdown because HTML-inside-markdown is part of
the spec. That said, remember that the spec disallows markdown nested
inside of HTML. So if you create a div, just make sure everything
inside that div is valid HTML.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_EXPORT md
<div class="inset">
#+END_EXPORT
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png]]
#+BEGIN_EXPORT md
</div>
#+END_EXPORT
