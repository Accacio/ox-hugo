* How to compile the site
1. Be the root directory for this Hugo site (the directory containing =config.toml=).
2. Run "hugo server --port 1111"
3. See the site served on "http://localhost:1111/"
* Source blog posts in Org
Location: =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content-org/=

The directory does not have to be =content-org=, but it has to be
outside the =hugo= Contents dir =content/=.
* Tested to work on
- hugo v0.25-DEV updated today
- org master updated today
- emacs master updated today
