NOTE TO FUTURE CONTRIBUTORS: I plan to merge this package into GNU
Elpa or Org source at some point.

So you will need to assign your copyright to FSF in order to get your
patches accepted.

-   [Why assign copyright to FSF?](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html)
-   [How to start this process](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html#Copyright-Papers)

As a bonus, once you have assigned your copyright to FSF, doors open up
for your future contributions to Emacs too!
