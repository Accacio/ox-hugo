#+TITLE: Ox-Hugo Manual

=ox-hugo= is an Emacs package to export Org files to Hugo-compatible
Markdown files.  At the moment it supports only the [[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday
Markdown]] flavor.
* Hugo specific export settings
** Mandatory settings
- HUGO_SECTION :: The default Hugo section name for all the posts.  See
                  [[http://gohugo.io/content/sections/][here]] for more information on Hugo sections.  It is
                  common for this property to be set to =posts= or
                  =blog=.
- HUGO_BASE_DIR :: Root directory of the source for the Hugo site.
     If this is set to =~/hugo/=, the exported Markdown files will be
     saved to =~/hugo/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/= directory.  By [[http://gohugo.io/content/organization/][default]],
     the Markdown files reside in a hierarchy under the =content/=
     directory in the site root directory.
** Optional settings
