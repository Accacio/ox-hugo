=ox-hugo= is an Emacs package to export Org files to Hugo-compatible
Markdown files.  At the moment it supports only the [[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday
Markdown]] flavor.
* Hugo specific export settings
** Mandatory settings
- HUGO_SECTION :: The default Hugo section name for all the posts.  See
                  [[http://gohugo.io/content/sections/][here]] for more information on Hugo sections.  It is
                  common for this property to be set to =posts= or
                  =blog=.
- HUGO_BASE_DIR :: Root directory of the source for the Hugo site.
     If this is set to =~/hugo/=, the exported Markdown files will be
     saved to =~/hugo/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/= directory.  By [[http://gohugo.io/content/organization/][default]],
     the Markdown files reside in a hierarchy under the =content/=
     directory in the site root directory.

** 0.1.1
- Use CLOSED log drawer info if available to set the date in
  front-matter {{{issue(68)}}}.
- Code optimization: Use of =org-entry-get= at places instead of
  maintaining global variables.

NOTE TO FUTURE CONTRIBUTORS: I plan to merge this package into GNU
Elpa or Org source at some point.

So you will need to assign your copyright to FSF in order to get your
patches accepted.

* Debug
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: debug
:END:
If the =ox-hugo= exports do not work as expected, or if you get an
error backtrace,
1. Open an [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues][Issue]].
2. Describe the problem you are seeing.
3. Provide the debug info using =org-hugo-debug-info=:
   - =M-x org-hugo-debug-info= (that will copy the debug info in
     Markdown format to the kill ring)
   - Paste the Markdown contents in the GitHub issue.
     - You can still hit the /Preview/ tab of the Issue before
       submitting it.

:EXPORT_TITLE: Ox-Hugo: A carefully crafted Org exporter back-end that enables writing Hugo posts in Org
:END:
{{{GPLv3}}} {{{melpa}}}

=ox-hugo= is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to
[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]-compatible Markdown ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]]) and also generates the
front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

This project consists of =ox-blackfriday.el= too. It is a derivation
of [[https://github.com/larstvei/ox-gfm][=ox-gfm=]] with support added for Blackfriday Markdown tables and
many other tweaks. =ox-hugo= backend extends from this.

There are 2 major blogging flows that can be used with this package:
1. One post per Org subtree (preferred)
   - Export only the *current* post Org subtree, or
   - Export all valid Hugo post subtrees in a loop.
2. One post per Org file
   - This works but you won't be able to leverage Org-specific
     benefits like tag and property inheritance, use of TODO states to
     translate to post =draft= state, auto weight calculation for
     posts and menu items, etc.

See the [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/wiki/Org-Capture-Setup][Org Capture Setup]] Wiki page to see how to quickly create new
posts.

See the [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/wiki/Auto-export-on-Saving][Auto-export on Saving]] Wiki page to learn how to setup up
seeing live-preview of the Hugo-rendered HTML each time you do =C-x
C-s= in the Org file --- For now, this works only with the *Subtree
export flow*.

Before you read further, you can see below how =ox-hugo= translates
Org to Markdown (Org on the left; exported Markdown with Hugo
front-matter on the right).

** Why =ox-hugo=?                                                      :wiki:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_TITLE:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Why ox-hugo?
:END:
Using Org just as a markup like Markdown is a miniscule part of its
complete feature-set. Org also allows stuff like:
- Easy ordering/manipulation/commenting of subtrees
- Creating tables (with even formulas like in Excel)
- Directly including source code snippets from external files (instead
  of having to copy/paste them in)
- Running code snippets within the Org file and embedding the results
  (Org Babel)
- ..

Using Org for content writing allows using in-built Org features to
translate to Hugo front-matter:

- Org uses an outline structure and can inherit meta data (tags and
  properties) from one subtree to children subtrees.
- Using that feature, one can tag one tree as /emacs/, and everything
  under that tree (all posts under that) will get that tag
  automatically.
- The same concept applies to inheriting any Org /property/ meta data
  like menu entry, category, section name, etc.
- A subtree can be quickly marked to be in TODO state (default binding
  =C-c C-t=). A *TODO* post is marked as a /draft/ Hugo post.
- The /menu-item weights/ and/or /post weights/ can be set to be
  auto-calculated so that the menu items or post order in the final
  HTML appear in the same order as the respective subtrees in Org.

  If the subtrees are re-ordered in Org, the weights get changed too.
- One can have a subtree with section property set to "posts" and all
  post subtrees under that will go to that section. Similarly another
  parent subtree can have that property set to "articles", and so on.
- Images can be displayed inline in the Org buffer.
- After save hooks can be set up in Emacs so that each time I save the
  file, only the current subtree in Org gets exported to
  Markdown. With the Hugo server running with the new switch that auto
  changes the preview to the last changed post (=--navigateToChanged=
  introduced in Hugo 0.25), the flow is seamless -- Save the Org file
  and see the exact changed post in browser.
- *All* posts can simply be subtrees in a single Org file. That way
  one can take advantage of Org subtree filtering and searching
  functions (=org-sparse-tree= bound to =C-c /= by default).
- (and much more..)
** Installation                                                        :wiki:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_TITLE:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Installation
:END:
This package requires emacs 24.5+ and Org 9.0+. It is available on Melpa.
** Usage                                                               :wiki:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_TITLE:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Usage
:END:
Once the package is installed, you will need to require it so that the
=ox-hugo= export options are available in the /Org Export Dispatcher/
menu (the one you see when you hit =C-c C-e= to initiate any export).

You can do that by adding the below to your config:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'ox
  (require 'ox-hugo))
#+END_SRC
If you use =use-package=, you can do the below instead:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-hugo
  :after ox)
#+END_SRC
*** Before you export
Before you export check that these properties are set as you need:
- HUGO_SECTION :: The default Hugo section name for all the posts.  See
                  [[http://gohugo.io/content/sections/][here]] for more information on Hugo sections.  It is
                  common for this property to be set to =posts= or
                  =blog=.  The default value is set using
                  =org-hugo-default-section-directory=.
- HUGO_BASE_DIR :: Root directory of the source for the Hugo site. If
                   this is set to =~/hugo/=, the exported Markdown
                   files will be saved to
                   =~/hugo/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/= directory.  By
                   default, the Markdown files reside in a hierarchy
                   under the =content/= directory in the site root
                   directory ([[http://gohugo.io/content/organization/][ref]]). If you try to export without
                   setting this property, you will get this error:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  user-error: It is mandatory to set the HUGO_BASE_DIR property
  #+END_EXAMPLE

*Important*: If you choose to export an Org subtree as a post, you
 need to set the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= subtree property. That property is
 used by this package to figure out where the current post starts.
*** Export bindings
The common =ox-hugo= export bindings are:
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Binding       | Description                                                                         |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-e H H= | Export only the current /valid/ subtree (has the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property set)   |
| =C-c C-e H A= | Export *all* /valid/ subtrees (those that have the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property set) |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-e H h= | Export the whole Org file to a single post                                          |

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Example Hugo site
:END:
An [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/example-site][example-site]] with bare-bones "theme" is used to live-test the
package --- you'll know why theme is double-quoted once you try out the
example-site on =hugo=.

Check out the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content-org/all-posts.org][example single Org file]]. That is created for testing various
Org->Hugo content and meta-data translation features. [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/example-site/content/posts][Here]] are the
exported Markdown files.
*** How to try =ox-hugo= on that site?
1. Clone this repo.
2. =cd= to the =example-site/= directory and do:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   - =--navigateToChanged= requires Hugo 0.25+.
3. Above command will mention the localhost where the site is
   served. Open that in your browser.
4. In emacs, =(require  'ox-hugo)= or evaluate the =ox-hugo.el= from the
   cloned repo.
5. Open the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/example-site/content-org/all-posts.org][=all-posts.org=]] file.
6. =C-c C-e H A= -- That will export *all* subtrees in the file to
   Markdown files.
7. In few seconds, dozens of test posts will get created, with the
   =hugo server= aided preview in the browser zapping through each new
   created post (needs that new feature =--navigateToChanged=
   introduced in Hugo 0.25).

:END:
1. =cd= to your Hugo site base directory -- the one that contains the
   =config.toml= (or =config.yaml= or =config.json=).
2. Start the =hugo server= in that directory:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   - =--navigateToChanged= requires Hugo 0.25+.
3. Above command will mention the localhost where the site is
   served. Open that in your browser.
4. Create a separate directory for Org content in the Hugo site base
   directory. You can name it anything, but I prefer to name it
   =content-org= ([[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/example-site][Example 1 -- =ox-hugo= example site]], [[https://gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/kaushalmodi.gitlab.io][Example 2 -- My
   blog]]).
5. Create an Org file in there and follow the *Usage* section in the
   [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo#usage][README]] or [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/wiki/Usage][Wiki]] to export it.

*** For subtree exports (=C-c C-e H H= or =C-c C-e H A=)
When organizing the posts as Org *subtrees*, many Hugo front-matter
variables get set implicitly using the meta-data parsed from the posts
in Org.

Below, where /subtree/ is mentioned, it implies a *valid Hugo-post
subtree* i.e. an Org subtree that has the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property
set.

**** Notes
- The auto weight calculation for posts and menu items works *only*
  for subtree exports. For the complete-file export flow, one needs to
  specify the weights manually if needed.

If you are considering to try out =ox-hugo=, and if you have already
been using Hugo, it is normal for this thought to cross your mind:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I already have dozens or hundreds of posts written in Markdown. Do I
need to convert them to Org if I want to start using =ox-hugo=?
#+END_QUOTE

The answer is *No*.

This package will export your future posts written in Org to
Markdown. And those files will live along with your already written
Markdown posts. So converting existing Markdown files to Org would be
purely the user's choice, your choice -- but that's by no means a
necessity if you want to start using =ox-hugo=.

.. And if at some point, you want to stop using =ox-hugo=, you still
have the exported Markdown files.

- New post creation using =org-capture= (port code from [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d/blob/master/setup-files/setup-hugo.el][here]]).
- Interactive functions to toggle /draft/ state,
  add/remove/increment/decrement /publishdate/ property.
- Option to use template =config.toml= and some default hugo theme. So
  all a new user would need to do is to (i) have the =hugo= [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases][binary]] in
  =PATH= (ii) define their =hugo= blog dir in the =defcustom= (iii)
  =M-x hugo=.
- Set separate faces for titles based on /draft/ state and
  /futureness/.

This project in unique in the sense that *all documentation* you see
in this repo is built from =doc/ox-hugo-manual.org= file.  That
includes the =README.org=, =CONTRIBUTING.org=, and these Wiki pages.

These are generated by running =M-x ox-hugo-export-gh-doc= defined in
=doc/export-gh-doc.el=. Before running that, you would need to:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd doc/
git clone https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo.wiki.git
#+END_SRC

If changes are only to this Wiki, I believe you can push them directly
using =git= or manually edit those here.

The preferred way to organize the posts is as Org subtrees (also the
main reason to write this package, as nothing like that was out there)
as it makes the meta-data management for Hugo front-matter pretty
effortless.

If you are a /one Org-file per post/ type of a person, that flow works
too! Just note that in this flow many of those =#+HUGO_= properties
need to be managed manually.. just as one would manage the front-matter
in Markdown files --- See the Org versions in the above screenshots for
comparison.

:PROPERTIES:

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Auto-export on Saving
:END:
Wouldn't it be awesome if you can see the live-preview of your
Hugo-rendered post each time you saved your post in Org?

Well.. you can do that with these steps, though, this works *only with
subtree-export flow* at the moment.
*** First time setup
**** Step 1: Set up the =after-save-hook=
1. Add below to the very-end of your posts Org file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   * Footnotes
   * COMMENT Local Variables                                           :ARCHIVE:
   # Local Variables:
   # eval: (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'org-hugo-export-subtree-to-md-after-save :append :local)
   # End:
   #+END_SRC

   Here I recommend adding the =* Footnotes= header too so that in
   case you add any Org footnotes, they go directly to that section
   you created. Otherwise, in the absence of an existing /Footnotes/
   heading, Org would create a new /Footnotes/ heading *at the end of
   the file* -- so the /Local Variables/ heading will then no longer be
   at the end of the file.
2. Then save the file, and do =revert-buffer=.
3. You will be prompted to add that =eval= line to your /Customize/
   setup, hit =!= to permanently save that setting and prevent future
   prompts.
**** Step 2: Prevent auto-export during Org Capture
You might find this step useful if you choose to write new posts using
=org-capture= as explained in the /Org Capture Setup/ Wiki page.

After saving the below to your emacs config and evaluating it,
auto-exports will be prevented when saving a new post created using
Org Capture.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
  ;; Do not cause auto Org->Hugo export to happen when saving captures
  (defun modi/org-capture--remove-auto-org-to-hugo-export-maybe ()
    "Function for `org-capture-before-finalize-hook'.
Disable `org-hugo-export-subtree-to-md-after-save'."
    (setq org-hugo-allow-export-after-save nil))

  (defun modi/org-capture--add-auto-org-to-hugo-export-maybe ()
    "Function for `org-capture-after-finalize-hook'.
Enable `org-hugo-export-subtree-to-md-after-save'."
    (setq org-hugo-allow-export-after-save t))

  (add-hook 'org-capture-before-finalize-hook #'modi/org-capture--remove-auto-org-to-hugo-export-maybe)
  (add-hook 'org-capture-after-finalize-hook #'modi/org-capture--add-auto-org-to-hugo-export-maybe))
#+END_SRC
*** Steps that /might/ need to be taken every time
**** Step 3: Start the engines (Hugo Server)
We start the =hugo server= so that we can see the live-preview each
time the Org file is saved.

I recommend using Hugo version 0.25 at the minimum as that added
support for the awesome =--navigateToChanged= switch!

Run below in your Hugo site root (the directory that contains the site
=config.toml=) to start the server:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
#+END_EXAMPLE
**** Step 4: Open your browser
By default the site is served locally on port /1313/ on
/localhost/. So the above step would have printed something like below
at the end:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
#+END_EXAMPLE

So open your favorite browser pointing to that address.
*** FINAL step that needs to be taken every time
If you are like me, you might not need to repeat steps 3 and 4 above,
as you can leave the =hugo= server running in a separate terminal, and
have a browser tab pinned to that localhost.

So with that, have the emacs and browser frames set up side-by-side,
and edit your Org post.

Hit =C-x C-s= and be in awe as the browser auto-refreshes to the
*exact post you modified*!
